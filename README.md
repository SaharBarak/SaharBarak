- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SaharBarak, Software Researcher, Builder.
- I believe humanity is going through a degovernization process of planet earth. 
- In the past year I've been researching and developing community involving technological mechanisms for sustainability and environmental relief.
- I believe actual change come from the people.
- I'm working on Seeder Protocol, Rent, Cherry, and other silly things that gives me joy.
- I pull most of my inspiration from nature.
